**Part 1**

**Part 2**

**Part 3**

In terminal, the run command, assuming you have both the test.in and solution.cpp file in your current working directory.

<code> g++ 0std=c++0x solution.cpp && ./a.out test.in</code>

This will create a *test.out* file containing the steps required to complete part 3 of the challenge.

### Tasks

Track the moves made by traversing backwards (Trudie)

Forward Track (Michael)

 - 0 = Replace

 - 2 = Insert
 - 3 = Nothing

Condense and write to output file (Eric)
Each operation as input is represented by vector{"Operation", "start No.", "end No.", "book names" }
Check if the operations are consecutive(repeatitive for delete), if they are, collapse the same operations.
